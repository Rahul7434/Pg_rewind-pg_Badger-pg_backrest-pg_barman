# Pg_rewind
```
```
pg_rewind is a Postgresql utility used to bring back old primary as standby after failvour without full base backup.

- Compares the timeline history between the target server (old primary) and the source server (current primary).
- Identifies the divergence point in the WAL files & Copies only the nessary data blocks and WAL changes from the source tothe target.
- Syncs the Data Directories of the target server with the current primary.
```
---
#### When to Use pg_rewind?
```
1.After a failover or switchover in streaming replication.
2.When the primary server becomes out or sync due to crash recovery.
3.To avoid a full pg_basebackup in high availability configurations.
```
#### Setup for pg_rewind 
```
- Must have WAL archiving on both servers & Streaming Replication Enabled.
- need super user access
- The old Primary (target) server must be shut down propely before running pg_rewind.
- wal_log_hints = on --(This parameter needs to be on on the new primary server to identify the changes between two server.)
```
#### Configuration Steps
- Change postgresql.conf file on Standby (New Primary):
```
wal_level = replica
archive_mode= on
archive_command = 'cp %p /path/archivelocation/%f'
max_wal_sender = 5
wal_keep_size = 64MB
hot_standby = on
```
- Restart the Primary server
```
systemctl restart postgresql
```
- Check the Divergence Point (on the current primary new primary)
```
SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn();
SELECT timeline_id FROM pg_control_checkpoint();
```
- Shout Down the old Primary (Target)
```
Systemctl stop postgresql
```
- Run pg_rewind  on the old primary (target).
```
pg_rewind -- target-pgdata=/var/lib/pgsql/16/data
--source-server="host=enter_ip, port= enter_port, user=postgres, password=enter_password"
```
- Create standby.signal file on (old Primary (target)).
```
cd /var/lib/pgsql/16/data
touch standby.signal

Add connection details in postgresql.conf
primary_conninfo = 'host= ip, port=port, user=username, password=password'


```

- Start the old primary as standby
```
systemctl start postgresql
```
```

# pg_backrest

```
pgBackRest is a reliable backup and restore tool for PostgreSQL.
The guide is sequential: each section builds on the previous one (e.g., Restore depends on Quick Start).
It‚Äôs designed for Debian/Ubuntu + PostgreSQL 16, but adaptable to other Unix systems.
Commands are tested on virtual machines, so examples are verified and trustworthy.
You should run commands as a non-root user with sudo access to both root and postgres.

# üõ†Ô∏è PostgreSQL Diagnostic Toolkit: pgBadger & pg_gather
```
pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer that reads database logs and generates detailed, visual reports about performance, errors, query behavior, and more.
It‚Äôs written in Perl, a powerful scripting language known for text processing.
It parses PostgreSQL logs and produces HTML reports with graphs and summaries.
It helps us to identify slow queries, monitor activity, and troubleshoot issues,monitor connection spikes, and audit system behavior
It does not require direct access to DB, it works entirely from log files.
```
```
## üîç What pgBadger Can Reveal

### üê¢ Slow Queries
- Shows queries that exceed a certain duration threshold.
- Highlights execution time, frequency, and source (user, database, client IP).
- Helps you pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

### üîÅ Repeated Queries
- Aggregates identical queries and shows how many times each was run.
- Useful for identifying inefficient query patterns or missing caching.

### üî¢ Total Query Count
- Displays total number of queries executed per hour/day.
- Breaks down by database, user, and application.

### üîí Blocked Queries / Lock Waits
- Detects queries that were blocked due to locks.
- Shows wait duration, affected tables, and conflicting sessions.
- Requires `log_lock_waits = on` in `postgresql.conf`.

### üßπ Autovacuum Activity
- Logs when autovacuum runs and on which tables.
- Shows duration and effectiveness.
- Requires `log_autovacuum_min_duration` to be set (e.g., `0` to log all).

### üß± Checkpoint Events
- Reports how often checkpoints occurred.
- Shows write and sync times, WAL file sizes.
- Requires `log_checkpoints = on`.

### üîå Connection Stats
- Tracks connections and disconnections.
- Shows spikes in session counts, client IPs, and failed login attempts.
- Requires `log_connections = on` and `log_disconnections = on`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Errors & Warnings
- Captures syntax errors, permission issues, deadlocks, and failed queries.
- Helps with debugging and auditing.

### üìä Performance Graphs
HTML report includes:
- Query duration histogram
- Connections over time
- Checkpoint frequency
- Lock wait distribution

### üß† Bonus Insights (If Logging Is Enabled)
- Temporary file usage (indicates memory pressure)
- Statement types breakdown (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, etc.)
- Top 10 slowest queries
- Top 10 most frequent queries
- Application-level stats (if `application_name` is set)
```

## üì¶ 1. pgBadger ‚Äî PostgreSQL Log Analyzer

### üîß Installation Steps

#### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL must be configured to log queries.
- Perl must be installed (pgBadger is written in Perl).

#### üñ•Ô∏è Install pgBadger (Linux)
```bash
sudo apt install pgbadger   # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install pgbadger   # RHEL/CentOS
```

#### üß∞ Configure PostgreSQL Logging
Edit `postgresql.conf`:
```conf
logging_collector = on
log_directory = 'pg_log'
log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log'
log_statement = 'mod'       # or 'all' for full query logging
log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h '
log_duration = on
```

Restart PostgreSQL:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

---

### üìä Generate Report
```bash
pgbadger /var/lib/pgsql/pg_log/*.log -o /tmp/pgbadger_report.html
```

#### üîç Optional Flags
```bash
-j 4                 # Use 4 CPU cores for parallel parsing
-f stderr            # Specify log format
-b "2025-09-01"      # Start date
-e "2025-09-07"      # End date
```

---

### üîÑ Backend Workflow

1. PostgreSQL writes logs to `pg_log/` based on your config.
2. pgBadger parses these logs line by line.
3. It extracts:
   - Query durations
   - Errors and warnings
   - Checkpoint and vacuum activity
   - Connection stats
4. It builds an HTML report with graphs and summaries.

üìå **No direct DB access** ‚Äî it works entirely from log files.

---

## üß† 2. pg_gather ‚Äî SQL-Based Health Snapshot Tool

### üîß Installation Steps

#### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- No installation needed ‚Äî just download the SQL scripts.
- Requires access to `psql` and a PostgreSQL user with read privileges.

#### üì• Download Scripts
From the official repo or trusted source:
- `gather.sql`
- `gather_report.sql`
- `history_schema.sql` (optional for storing snapshots)

---

### üìä Run Data Collection
```bash
psql -U postgres -d mydb -f gather.sql > /tmp/db_snapshot.tsv
```

### üìä Generate Report
Import snapshot into analysis DB:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d analysis_db -f history_schema.sql
\copy gather_data FROM '/tmp/db_snapshot.tsv' WITH CSV
psql -U postgres -d analysis_db -f gather_report.sql
```

---

### üîÑ Backend Workflow

1. `gather.sql` runs SQL queries against system catalogs:
   - `pg_stat_user_tables`, `pg_stat_statements`, `pg_class`, `pg_index`
2. It collects:
   - Table bloat
   - Index usage
   - Autovacuum stats
   - Configuration parameters
   - Replication lag
3. Output is saved as TSV for portability.
4. `gather_report.sql` analyzes the snapshot and generates insights.

üìå **No external dependencies** ‚Äî works entirely via SQL.

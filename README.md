# Pg_rewind
```
pg_rewind is a Postgresql utility used to bring back old primary as standby after failvour without full base backup.

- Compares the timeline history between the target server (old primary) and the source server (current primary).
- Identifies the divergence point in the WAL files & Copies only the nessary data blocks and WAL changes from the source tothe target.
- Syncs the Data Directories of the target server with the current primary.
```
---
#### When to Use pg_rewind?
```
1.After a failover or switchover in streaming replication.
2.When the primary server becomes out or sync due to crash recovery.
3.To avoid a full pg_basebackup in high availability configurations.
```
#### Setup for pg_rewind 
```
- Must have WAL archiving on both servers & Streaming Replication Enabled.
- need super user access
- The old Primary (target) server must be shut down propely before running pg_rewind.
- wal_log_hints = on --(This parameter needs to be on on the new primary server to identify the changes between two server.)
```
#### Configuration Steps
- Change postgresql.conf file on Standby (New Primary):
```
wal_level = replica
archive_mode= on
archive_command = 'cp %p /path/archivelocation/%f'
max_wal_sender = 5
wal_keep_size = 64MB
hot_standby = on
```
- Restart the Primary server
```
systemctl restart postgresql
```
- Check the Divergence Point (on the current primary new primary)
```
SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn();
SELECT timeline_id FROM pg_control_checkpoint();
```
- Shout Down the old Primary (Target)
```
Systemctl stop postgresql
```
- Run pg_rewind  on the old primary (target).
```
pg_rewind -- target-pgdata=/var/lib/pgsql/16/data
--source-server="host=enter_ip, port= enter_port, user=postgres, password=enter_password"
```
- Create standby.signal file on (old Primary (target)).
```
cd /var/lib/pgsql/16/data
touch standby.signal

Add connection details in postgresql.conf
primary_conninfo = 'host= ip, port=port, user=username, password=password'


```

- Start the old primary as standby
```
systemctl start postgresql
```

# repmgr
```
🛠️ Prerequisites (Before Configuration)
Make sure the following are in place on both master and standby servers:
PostgreSQL installed (same version across nodes)
repmgr installed (matching PostgreSQL version)
Network access between nodes (default PostgreSQL port: 5432)
SSH access between nodes (for repmgr to execute remote commands)
Time synchronization (e.g., via NTP)

⚙️ PostgreSQL Configuration
Update postgresql.conf on all nodes:
wal_level = 'replica'
max_wal_senders = 10
max_replication_slots = 10
hot_standby = on
archive_mode = on
archive_command = '/bin/true'
shared_preload_libraries = 'repmgr'

Update pg_hba.conf to allow replication and repmgr connections:
# Replication access
host    replication     repmgr     192.168.1.0/24     trust

# repmgr access
host    repmgr          repmgr     192.168.1.0/24     trust

🧑‍💻 User and Database Setup
Create a dedicated user and database for repmgr:

CREATE USER repmgr SUPERUSER;
CREATE DATABASE repmgr OWNER repmgr;

📁 repmgr.conf Configuration
Each node needs a repmgr.conf file. Key parameters include:

Parameter               Description
--------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------------
node_id                 Unique ID for each node
node_name               Descriptive name of the node
conninfo                Connection string to PostgreSQL (host=... user=repmgr dbname=repmgr)
data_directory          Path to PostgreSQL data directory
pg_bindir               Path to PostgreSQL binaries (e.g., /usr/pgsql-13/bin)
log_file                Path to repmgr log file
failover                automatic or manual
promote_command         Command to promote standby to primary
follow_command          Command to follow new primary after failover
reconnect_attempts      Number of attempts to reconnect during failover
reconnect_interval      Interval between reconnect attempts
monitoring_history      Number of monitoring records to keep
priority                Priority for failover (lower number = higher priority)

Example:
node_id=1
node_name=node1
conninfo='host=192.168.1.10 user=repmgr dbname=repmgr'
data_directory='/var/lib/pgsql/13/data'
pg_bindir='/usr/pgsql-13/bin'
log_file='/var/log/repmgr/repmgr.log'
failover=automatic
promote_command='/usr/pgsql-13/bin/repmgr standby promote -f /etc/repmgr.conf'
follow_command='/usr/pgsql-13/bin/repmgr standby follow -f /etc/repmgr.conf'
priority=100


🚀 Setup Steps
On Primary Node:
1.Register the primary:
repmgr primary register

On Standby Node:
2.Clone the standby:
repmgr standby clone --force --verbose

3.Register the standby:
repmgr standby register

🔄 Post-Setup: Enable Daemon
Start the repmgr daemon (repmgrd) on all nodes:

repmgrd -f /etc/repmgr.conf --daemonize

```
